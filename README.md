# RNA-seq workflow: gene-level exploratory analysis and differential expression

### Abstract
Here we walk through an end-to-end gene-level RNA-seq differential expression workflow using Bioconductor packages. We will start from the FASTQ files, show how these were quantified to the reference transcripts, and prepare gene-level count datasets for downstream analysis. We will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) for quality assessment and to explore the relationship between samples, perform differential gene expression analysis, and visually explore the results.
